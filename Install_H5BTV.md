# Installing the Hustler 5BTV 

## Prep

Cut 30 x 8m radials and install a ring terminator.

## Installing the mounting Pole

Find the general location for the mast.  Start with around 8m from the
pergola and both sidewalks.

Dig the hole 4' deep, cement the steel fence post.  Ensure that it's
perfectly vertical.

1-5/8 in. x 6 ft. Steel fence post.

Install Radial plate to post.

## Marking out the plot

Line up the radial plate with where it will be mounted if it's not
mounted already.

Use a dotted line to mark out an 8m radius from the center of the radial
plate.

Measure a line with two tent stakes 837 mm apart.  This is the chord
length between two radials on the 8m circle.  Mark out each radial
starting with the one that will point toward the NW corner of the house.
Having this radial as close to the corner of the house will make for a
good trench around the corner and into the garage.

### Chord length

Internal angle = 360 / 60.  A line drawn from the center of the circle
to intersect the radial chord at 90 degrees cuts the internal angle in
two and crates a hypotenuse as an 8m radius to the circle.  Therefore
sin(3) = 8m/chord = .837m.

## Attaching Radials

Lay the radials 

## Mounting the Antenna

Note: Add maintenance slack to antenna end of the transmission line Coax.

Consider spraying with clear enamel when done.  This will help protect
the nuts and bolts from corrosion.

Don't forget a small maintenance look in the radial wires.
