As built instructions trying to build a LEO Satellite antenna following
the design by [WA5VJB](http://www.wa5vjb.com/references/Cheap%20Antennas-LEOs.pdf)


 * 6 1/8" Brass Brazing rodes coated in Silica Flux.
 * 1 Packet of three Brass Tubes: K&S #5128


The brass rods are ~36" but not exactly.  So splice, measure and cut in
the right order to get the necessary elements.


## 145MHz Driver
1. Spice together two of the 36" Rods with 1/2" of Brass Tube and solder
2. Bend at 90째 at the 38.5" mark just past the splice.
3. Bend at 90째 1" parrallel to the main element to double back on itself.
4. Cut the folded element at 19.25"

## 145MHz Reflector
1. Cut 22.5" from two of the 36" Rods
2. Splice together with 5/8" of Brass Tube

## 145MHz Director 1
1. Cut 18.25" from two 36" Rods
2. Splice together with 5/8" of Brass Tube

## 435 MHz Driver
1. Splice the two scraps left from creating 145MHz D1 (they are ~17.5" long)
2. Bend at 90째 at the 13"
3. Bend at 90째 1" parrallel to the main element to double back on itself.
4. Cut the folded element at 6.5" 

## 435 MHz Reflectors and Directors
1.  At this point you should have the scraps that you need to cut the
remaining elements.
